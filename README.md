# nextcloud-smb

My customized Nextcloud docker image. <br/>
It adds support for: 
* SMB
* PDF OCR through <a href="https://github.com/R0Wi/workflow_ocr">this project</a>
* Face recognition through <a href="https://apps.nextcloud.com/apps/facerecognition">this project</a> 
<br/>
It is build automatically when the nextcloud base image is updated.<br/>

Currently tracking the nextcloud <i>28-apache</i> branch.<br/>
The nextcloud27 branch tracks 27-apache and will keep autobuilding as long as nextcloud releases upgrades
